== README

-----
The Bookstore app doesn't entirely follow the 'DRY' method, becuase the Categories#show is an exact replica of the Books#show.
The Ruby Way of fixing this would be to turn it into a partial, such as _books.html.erb and render it on both the pages. I willing did it the non-DRY way.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

* Ruby version: 2.0

* Database: MySQL w/XAMPP
